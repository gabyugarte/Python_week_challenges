# Team Activity W08
# CORE 1: Within your program, the print_death_age function must print the name
# and age at death for each person in the people dictionary.
# CORE 2: The count_genders function must count and print the number of males
# and the number of females in the people dictionary.

# marriage in the marriages dictionary:
#  - The name and age in the wedding year of the husband
#  - The year of the wedding
#  - The name and age in the wedding year of the wife

# Each value in the people dictionary is a list. These
# are the indexes of the elements in those lists.
