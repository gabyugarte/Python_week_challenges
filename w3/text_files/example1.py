# Example 1
'''
Example 1 contains a program that opens a text file named plants.txt for reading at line 28. At line 32 there is a for loop that reads the text in the file one line at a time and repeats the body of the for loop once for each line of text in the file. In the body of the for loop at lines 34–40, the code removes surrounding white space, if there is any, from each line of text and then stores each line of text in a list.

    # Read the contents of a text file
    # named plants.txt into a list.
    text_list = read_list("plants.txt")

    # Print the entire list.
