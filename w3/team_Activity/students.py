# Team Activity: W09

# Problem Statement: A common task for many knowledge workers is to use a
# number, key, or ID to find information about a person. For example, a
# knowledge worker may use a phone number or e-mail address as a key to find
# (or look up) additional information about a customer. During this activity,
# your team will write a Python program that uses a student's I-Number to look
# up the student's name.

# CORE 1: Open the students.csv file for reading, skip the first line of text
# in the file because it contains only headings, and read the other lines of
# the file into a dictionary. The program must store each student I-Number as
# a key and each I-Number name pair or each name as a value in the dictionary.
# CORE 2: Get an I-Number from the user, use the I-Number to find the
# corresponding student name in the dictionary, and print the name.
# CORE 3: If a user enters an I-Number that doesn't exist in the dictionary,
# your program must print the message, "No such student" (without the quotes).
# STRETCH 1: Add code to remove dashes from the I-Number that the user enters.
# This will allow the user to enter I-Numbers with dashes or without dashes and
# still allow the computer to search in the dictionary.
# STRETCH 2: When a user enters an I-Number, your program should ensure it is
# a valid I-Number.
# a. If there are too few digits in the I-Number, your program should print,
# "Invalid I-Number: too few digits" (without the quotes).
# b. If there are too many digits in the I-Number, your program should print,
# "Invalid I-Number: too many digits" (without the quotes).
# c. If the given I-Number contains any characters besides digits and dashes,
# your program should output "Invalid I-Number" (without the quotes).
